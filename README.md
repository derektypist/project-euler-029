# Project Euler 029 - Distinct Powers

Consider all integer combinations for a to the power of b for a between 2 and 5 and b between 2 and 5.

    2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4=16, 2^5 = 32
    3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243
    4^2 = 16, 4^3 = 64, 4^4 = 256, 4^5 = 1024
    5^2 = 25, 5^3 = 125, 5^4 = 625, 5^5 = 3125

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

    4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

The aim is to find the number of distinct terms in the sequence generated by a to the power of b for a between 2 and n and b between 2 and n.
